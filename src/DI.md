##DI

There is one golden prerequisite for Dependency Injection and that is, Separation of Concerns. Put simply, group logic in separable units, and let these units work together, without any of them knowing much about the implementation details of the other. OOP calls such units classes, and FP, functions. The point is, units isolate common logic. Letâ€™s add to this the requirement that no unit explicitly instantiates the units it works with (dependencies). Instead, dependencies are passed upon the unit (injected), usually, during its instantiation.
